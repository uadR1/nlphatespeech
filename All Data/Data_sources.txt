        - It contains 25.296 Tweets that are classified as: neutral, offensive langugage & hatespeech 
        - There are some missing classifications
        - There is also a count of people who classified the tweets - minimum is three 
        - Also the count of people judged the tweet to be in any of the three classes is given
        - This makes the classification very transparent
